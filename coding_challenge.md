Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

Please organize, design, and document and your code as you build it. Please try
and keep commits small and meaningful, rather than as one giant commit of the
finished project.

Functional spec
---------------

Prototype **one** of the following projects:

1. Best Pizza Around Town
2. GitHub Followers

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional
features a user might find useful!


#### Best Pizza Around Town

Create a service that shows a list of the best pizza locations around the world.
The user should be able to click on any pizzeria in the list to get more details
about the pizzeria.

Information on the pizza API is available here: [Pizza API](pizza_api.md)


#### GitHub Followers

Create a service that allows for a user to search for a GitHub username. On a
successful search return, display the user's GitHub handle, follower count, and
a list of the user's public repositories. Each repository should link to it's
corresponding GitHub page.

Information on the GitHub API is available here: [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)


Technical spec
--------------

We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about
using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them.

Therefore, feel free to mention in your `README` how much experience you have
with the technical choices you make, we will take note of that when reviewing
your challenge.

The front-end should ideally be a single page app with a single `index.html`
linking to external JS/CSS/etc. You may take this opportunity to demonstrate
your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework
that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).


How will we review?
